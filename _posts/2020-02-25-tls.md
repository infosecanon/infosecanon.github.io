Recap
---------
- [ ] We need to show a stronger comparison against prior work
- [ ] Show how the dataset is used in practice
- [ ] Defend why we used TLS 1.2 over TLS 1.3
- [ ] Show a comparison against other datasets - be specific about the feature differences and where they come from 
- [ ] Adjust the tone of the paper to be easier to follow (stop going from technical to high level)
- [ ] More detail on surfing from users 
- [ ] Justify the false positive / false negative argument 
- [x] Conferences identified: SecureComm (due 5/4/2020) and ACSAC (due 6/15/2020)


## TLS Discussion
- [x] Defend why we used TLS 1.2 over TLS 1.3

There are a number of TLS vulnerabilities that are only available in TLS 1.2 or lower at the time of writing (022520). Looks like the majority of vulnerabilities against TLS are mostly against weak cipher suites that were removed from 1.3
(only Diffie Hellman is allowed).

At the time of writing, TLS 1.2 still holds the majority of market share: 30% in Chrome, 27% in Firefox, 27% in Safari circa August 2019. The bulk of vulnerabilities are in TLS 1.2, not that we have any attacks in the traffic leveraging that... heh, but it *is* more prevalent.
